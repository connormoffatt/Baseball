# Pythagorean Relationship for Other Sports

# Bill James' Pythagorean formula has been used for predicting winning 
# percentage in other sports. Since the pattern of scoring is very different
# among sports (compare for example points in basketball and goals in soccer),
# the formula needs to be adapted for the scoring environment. Find the
# necessary data for a sport of your choice and compute the optimal exponent
# to the Pythagorean formula
